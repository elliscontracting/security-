* `sha384WithRSAEncryption`
* `sha512WithRSAEncryption`

> [!Note]
> When NuGet’s [signature validation mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/installing-signed-packages#configure-package-signature-requirements) is set to accept (default), NU3013 is raised as a warning. 
> When NuGet’s signature validation mode is set to require, or when running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3013 is elevated from a warning to an error.
