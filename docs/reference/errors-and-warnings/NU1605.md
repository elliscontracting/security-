# NuGet Warning NU1605

## Example 1

<pre>Detected package downgrade: 'PackageB' from 4.0.0 to 3.5.0. Reference the package directly from the project to select a different version.<br/>  'PackageA' 3.5.0 -> 'PackageB' 3.5.0<br/>  'PackageC' 4.0.0 -> 'PackageD' 4.0.0 -> 'PackageB' 4.0.0</pre>

### Issue
A dependency package specified a version constraint on a higher version of a package than restore ultimately resolved. That is because of the [nearest-wins](../../concepts/dependency-resolution.md#nearest-wins) rule - when resolving packages, the version of the nearer package in the graph will override that of the distant package with the same ID.

### Solution
To the project exhibiting the restore error, add a package reference to the higher version of the package.

In the example above, you would add a package reference to Package B version 4.0.0:

<pre>
  'PackageA' 3.5.0 -> 'PackageB' 3.5.0<br/>
  'PackageC' 4.0.0 -> 'PackageD' 4.0.0 -> 'PackageB' 4.0.0<br/>
  'PackageB' 4.0.0
</pre>

Since, [nearest-wins](../../concepts/dependency-resolution.md#nearest-wins), the direct package reference to PackageB v4.0.0, will take precedence over the transitive reference to PackageB v3.5.0.

## Example 2

<pre>Detected package downgrade: Microsoft.NETCore.App from 2.1.8 to 2.1.0. Reference the package directly from the project to select a different version.<br/>
  test -> mvc -> Microsoft.NETCore.App (>= 2.1.8)<br/>
  test -> Microsoft.NETCore.App (>= 2.1.0)<br/>
</pre>

### Issue
The mvc project specified a version constraint on a higher version of a package than restore ultimately resolved. That is because of the [nearest-wins](../../concepts/dependency-resolution.md#nearest-wins) rule - when resolving packages, the version of the nearer package in the graph will override that of the distant package with the same ID.

### Solution
This specific error (with Microsoft.NETCore.App package) is improved my moving your .NET Core SDK to 2.2.100 or later. Microsoft.NETCore.App is an auto-referenced package that the .NET Core SDK before version 3.0.100 chooses to bring in automatically. Also see [Self-contained deployment runtime roll forward](/dotnet/core/deploying/runtime-patch-selection).
