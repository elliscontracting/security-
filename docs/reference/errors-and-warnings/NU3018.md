# NuGet Warning NU3018

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The primary signature found a chain building issue: A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider.</pre>

### Issue

NuGet client failed to verify the certificate chain for the signing certificate used to sign the package.


### Solution

Please ensure that the package signature has a valid certificate chain. You can verify the package signature by running the `nuget verify -signatures` command on the package. If the problem persists, then please file an issue at [NuGet/Home](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues) along with the package that generated this problem.


> [!Note]
> When NuGet’s [signature validation mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/installing-signed-packages#configure-package-signature-requirements) is set to accept (default), NU3018 is raised as a warning. 
> When NuGet’s signature validation mode is set to require, or when running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3018 is elevated from a warning to an error in most cases.
