# NuGet Error NU1105

<pre>Unable to read project information for 'ProjectFile'. The project file may be invalid or missing targets required for restore.</pre>

### Issue
The project file exists but no restore information was provided for it.

### Solution
In Visual Studio, the error could mean that the project is unloaded, in which case reload the project. From the command line this could mean that the file is corrupt or that it doesn't contain the custom "after imports" target needed for restore to read the project. Check that the project file is valid and contains an "after imports" target.
