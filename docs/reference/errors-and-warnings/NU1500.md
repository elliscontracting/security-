# NuGet Warning NU1500

### Issue
The NuGet operation had a problem. NU1500 is used when we haven't yet assigned a unique warning code for that issue. So we can improve, please feel free to [file the issue](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) with details of your error.

### Solution
Check the output window (in Visual Studio) or console output (with NuGet command line tools) for more information.
