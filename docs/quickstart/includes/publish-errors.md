Errors from the `push` command typically indicate the problem. For example, you may have forgotten to update the version number in your project and are therefore trying to publish a package that already exists.

You also see errors when trying to publish a package using an identifier that already exists on the host. The name "AppLogger", for example, already exists. In such a case, the `push` command gives the following error:

```output
Response status code does not indicate success: 403 (The specified API key is invalid,
has expired, or does not have permission to access the specified package.).
```

If you're using a valid API key that you just created, then this message indicates a naming conflict, which isn't entirely clear from the "permission" part of the error. Change the package identifier, rebuild the project, recreate the `.nupkg` file, and retry the `push` command.
